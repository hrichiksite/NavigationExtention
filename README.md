- [ ] To Compile It As An Extention To Use
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Make Compilable With Kodular
- [ ] Supported

### Contributors are Welcome. :smile:

##### Note: This is not currently compilable as I don't know much about JAVA, but soon it will be with the help of others. 
##### This Source Is Incompatible with AppyBuilder Code Editor IDE. As this Extention needs external libreries (.jar)
